# rock-paper-scissors
Rock, paper, scissors project for The Odin Project

My first project using JavaScript. I'm excited to learn how to make a website more interactive.

After a slow start, things started to click and I'm proud to say I've made a silly little game of Rock, Paper, Scissors from scratch! I've learned how to make the computer choose a random variable from an array, how to use a 'for' loop properly, and how to use a prompt so that a user can imput information.
